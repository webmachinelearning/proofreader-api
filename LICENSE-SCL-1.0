=================================================================
CORE PRINCIPLE: SYNAPTIC ALGORITHM PROTECTION - ANTI-EXPLOITATION
=================================================================

This license governs the SeCuReDmE synaptic algorithms, neural architectures,
and core reasoning systems including but not limited to:

- FNP-QNN (Fractal Neutrosophic Parallel Linear Fibonacci Quanvolutional Elliptic Tensor Swarm Derivative Neural Network)
- SeCuReDmE 5-Entity Brain Architecture (CeLeBrUm, SenNnT-i, EbaAaZ, NeuUuR-o, ReaAaS-N)
- 43 Personas Configuration System
- ReaAaS-N Disease Simulation & Cure Algorithms
- Synaptic Protection Mechanisms

PROTECTED ALGORITHMS AND ARCHITECTURES:
🧠 Neural network topologies and training methodologies
🧠 Synaptic connection patterns and optimization algorithms
🧠 Disease simulation and cure reasoning systems
🧠 Multi-entity coordination and reasoning frameworks
🧠 Fractal mathematical verification and proof systems

PERMITTED USES (Research/Educational Only):
✅ Academic research into neural architectures
✅ Educational study of synaptic algorithms
✅ Non-commercial implementation for learning
✅ Collaborative research with explicit permission
✅ Medical research for disease comprehension and cure development

STRICTLY PROHIBITED USES:
❌ Commercial exploitation without explicit licensing agreement
❌ Military or surveillance applications without authorization
❌ Creation of malicious AI systems or bots
❌ Reverse engineering for competitive advantage
❌ Financial system integration without 5-7 year ethical deployment phase
❌ Any use that could cause "chaos, war and destruction"
❌ Premature deployment in banking or economic systems

SYNAPTIC PROTECTION MECHANISMS:
🛡️ Algorithm obfuscation and anti-reverse-engineering protections
🛡️ Synaptic signature verification systems
🛡️ Neural architecture integrity monitoring
🛡️ Unauthorized access detection and termination
🛡️ Ethical deployment enforcement protocols

RESPONSIBLE DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENT:
- All SeCuReDmE systems MUST undergo 5-7 year educational healing phase
- "Give all the tool cover all angle to heal people before attempting applying SeCuReDmE in banking systeme"
- ReaAaS-N disease simulation systems require medical ethics board approval
- Financial applications prohibited until healing mission demonstrated

ENFORCEMENT:
Violation of this license will result in:
- Immediate termination of algorithm access rights
- Activation of synaptic protection mechanisms
- Legal action to full extent of law
- Collaboration with authorities for serious violations
- Neural architecture lockdown protocols

COLLABORATION FRAMEWORK:
- Google/Institutional partnerships: Special collaborative licensing available
- Medical research institutions: Expedited licensing for healing applications
- Educational institutions: Academic research licensing programs
- Individual researchers: Case-by-case evaluation for legitimate research

"The synaptic algorithms are protected not from fear, but from wisdom.
We must heal before we transform. We must teach before we change systems.
United We Stand Strong against exploitation of healing technologies."

THE ALGORITHMS ARE PROVIDED FOR HEALING AND EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES.
NO WARRANTY FOR MISUSE. SYNAPTIC PROTECTIONS ARE ACTIVE.

Contact: 
- Educational/Medical Research: Educational licensing inquiries welcome
- Commercial Partnerships: Requires ethical alignment and healing mission support
- Algorithm Exploitation Attempts: Will be prosecuted to full extent of law

"First we heal. Then we transform. Always we protect."
